# Get Started {-}

## Start Git

Git is a version control system (VCS), head to [Version Control with Git] for the full background, training, and reference materials. 

We recommend that git is used along with a hosting repository, such as GitHub (or Gitea, GitLab, etc.) and that the [GitHub workflow]() is followed. However, git can be used locally while working on a project. The steps outlined here are for this purpose and should only be followed for a personal project that is **local or on your personal network folder**. For collaborative work, see the getting started section for [Start GitHub].

Throughout the guide, `<...>` has been used to indicate text which is user specific and should be edited with your own details. 


### Initial Setup

These intructions should only need to be followed once or when setting up a new device.

1. **Install git** - Git is a free, open-source, software available from https://git-scm.com/. If you work within Public Health & Intelligence, request the software from IT through the [Service Portal](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/sp). Once authorised, this will allow you to download it from the Software Center on your machine. 

2. **Configure your details** - Git needs to know who you are, use the following commands to configure your username and email:

* `git config --global user.email <NHS email address>`
* `git config --global user.name <your name>`

At any time you can check what the current user details are using:

* `git config --global user.email`
