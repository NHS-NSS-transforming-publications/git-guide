## What is Version Control?

A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:

* Which changes were made?
* Who made the changes?
* When were the changes made?
* Why were changes needed?

We recommend that git is used along with a hosting repository, such as GitHub (or Gitea, GitLab, etc.) and that the GitHub workflow is followed.


## Git

According to the latest [Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology), more than 70 percent of developers use Git, making it the most-used VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial software development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and businesses:

* Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all the context they need to understand it and start contributing.
* Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git, collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to production code.
* Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate on major projects.

**What's a repository?**

A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.

Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and deprecated when no longer needed.

## Git Command Reference

### Git Basics
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git init [directory]` | Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialise the current directory as a git repository. |
| `git clone [repo]` | Clone repo located at `[repo]` onto local machine. Original repo can be located on the local file system or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH. |
| `git config user.name [name]` | Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use `--global` flag to set config options for current user. |
| `git add [directory]` | Stage all changes in `[directory]` for the next commit. Replace `[directory]` with a `[file]` to change a specific file. |
| `git commit -m “[message]”` | Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use [message] as the commit message. |
| `git status` | List which files are staged, unstated, and untracked. |
| `git log` | Display the entire commit history using the default format. For customisation see additional options. |
| `git diff` | Show unstated changes between your index and working directory. |

### Undoing changes
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git revert [commit]` | Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in `[commit]`, then apply it to the current branch. |
| `git reset [file]` | Remove `[file]` from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged. This un-stages a file without overwriting any changes. |
| `git clean -n` | Shows which files would be removed from working directory. Use the `-f` flag in place of the `-n` flag to execute the clean. |

### Rewriting Git History
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git commit —amend` | Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit combined. Use with nothing staged to edit the last commit’s message. |
| `git rebase [base]` | Rebase the current branch onto `[base]`. `[base]` can be a commit ID, a branch name, a tag, or a relative reference to `HEAD`. |
| `git reflog` | Show a log of changes to the local repository’s `HEAD`. Add `--relative-date` flag to show date info or `--all` to show all refs. |

### Git Branches
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git branch` | List all of the branches in your repo. Add a `branch` argument to create a new branch with the name `branch`. |
| `git checkout -b [branch]` | Create and check out a new branch named `[branch]`. Drop the `-b` flag to checkout an existing branch. |
| `git merge [branch]` | Merge `[branch]` into the current branch. |

### Remote Repositories
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git remote add [name] [url]` | Create a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote, you can use `[name]` as a shortcut for `[url]` in other commands. |
| `git fetch [remote] [branch]` | Fetches a specific `[branch]`, from the repo. Leave off `[branch]` to fetch all remote refs. |
| `git pull [remote]` | Fetch the specified remote’s copy of current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy. |
| `. git push [remote] [branch]` | Push the branch to `[remote]`, along with necessary commits and objects. Creates named branch in the remote repo if it doesn’t exist. |

### Git Config
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git config --global user.name [name]` | Define the author name to be used for all commits by the current user. |
| `git config --global user.email [email]` | Define the author email to be used for all commits by the current user. |
| `git config --global alias. [alias-name] [git-commands]` | Create shortcut for a Git command. E.g. `alias.glog log --graph --oneline` will set `git glog` equivalent to `git log --graph --oneline`. |
| `git config --system core.editor [editor]` | Set text editor used by commands for all users on the machine. `[editor]` arg should be the command that launches the desired editor (e.g., vi). |
| `git config --global --edit` | Open the global configuration file in a text editor for manual editing. |

### Git Log
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git log -[limit]` | Limit number of commits by `[limit]`. E.g. `git log -5` will limit to 5 commits. |
| `git log --oneline` | Condense each commit to a single line. |
| `git log -p` | Display the full diff of each commit. |
| `git log —-stat` | Include which files were altered and the relative number of lines that were added or deleted from each of them. |
| `git log —-author= ”[pattern]”` | Search for commits by a particular author. |
| `git log —grep=”[pattern]”` | Search for commits with a commit message that matches [pattern]. |
| `git log [since]..[until]` | Shows commits that occur between `[since]` and `[until]`. Args can be a commit ID, branch name, `HEAD`, or any other kind of revision reference. |
| `git log -- [file]` | Only display commits that have the specified file. |
| `git log --graph --decorate` | `--graph` flag draws a text based graph of commits on left side of commit msgs. `--decorate` adds names of branches or tags of commits shown. |

### Git Diff
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git diff HEAD` | Show difference between working directory and last commit. |
| `git diff --cached` | Show difference between staged changes and last commit. |

### Git Reset
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git reset` | Reset staging area to match most recent commit, but leave the working directory unchanged. |
| `git reset --hard` | Reset staging area and working directory to match most recent commit and *overwrites all changes* in the working directory. |
| `git reset [commit]` | Move the current branch tip backward to `[commit]`, reset the staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone. |
| `git reset --hard [commit]` | Same as previous, but resets both the staging area & working directory to match. Deletes uncommitted changes, and all commits after `[commit]`. |

### Git Rebase
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git rebase -i [base]` | Interactively rebase current branch onto `[base]`. Launches editor to enter commands for how each commit will be transferred to the new base. |

### Git Pull
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git pull --rebase [remote]` | Fetch the remote’s copy of current branch and rebases it into the local copy. Uses git rebase instead of merge to integrate the branches. |

### Git Push
| Command  | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `git push [remote] --force` | Forces the `git push` even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge. Do not use the `--force` flag unless you’re absolutely sure you know what you’re doing. |
| `git push [remote] --all` | Push all of your local branches to the specified remote. |
| `git push [remote] --tags` | Tags aren’t automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the —all flag. The —tags flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repo. |
