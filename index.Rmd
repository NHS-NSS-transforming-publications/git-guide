This is a comprehensive training and reference guide for Git (including a look at Shell scripting) GitHub, and the integrations into RStudio. 

There are four chapters, each with their own training, excersises, and reference sections:

1. Shell
2. Git
3. GitHub
4. RStudio

The book is created using bookdown (an R package) and hosted using GitHub. This should allow convenience for development and use, hassle-free updates, and contribution from users (from typos to suggestions).
