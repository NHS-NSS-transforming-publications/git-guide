This is a quick guide guide for Git, including a look at Shell scripting, GitHub, and the integrations into RStudio. There are references for further detailed and training on each of these topics.

There are four chapters, identifying setup, steps to follow, "cheat-sheets", and further reference materials:

1. Shell
2. Git
3. GitHub
4. RStudio

*The book is created using bookdown (an R package) and hosted using GitHub. This should allow convenience for development and use, hassle-free updates, and contribution from users (from typos to suggestions).*
