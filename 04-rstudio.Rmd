Version control can be very useful when developing data analysis scripts. For that reason, the popular development environment [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for the R programming language has built-in integration with Git. While some advanced Git features still require the command-line, RStudio has a nice interface for many common Git operations.  

RStudio allows us to create a project associated with a given directory to keep track of various related files. To be able to track the development of the project over time, to be able to revert to previous versions, and to collaborate with others, we version control the RStudio project with Git.
