Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with other people. We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.  

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories. In practice, though, it’s easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it on the web rather than on someone’s laptop. Most programmers use hosting services like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to hold those master copies; we’ll explore the pros and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.
